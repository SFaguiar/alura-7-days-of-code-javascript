Have you ever played a game that gave you more than one choice and, depending on what you chose, the character's fate would be completely different?

Today you will develop an example like this with Javascript!

I want you to work with control flow structures. This complicated way of speaking just means that, just like in games, the story you put together needs to adapt to the answers given by whoever is playing.

To do this, you will need some structures capable of changing the flow of the application, such as for, while, if and else. All of these can achieve this objective, given a certain condition.

The if and else, which I have already shown you in the last few days, are capable of creating branches within the application so that one or another action can be taken, depending on the condition provided.

Loops (such as for and while) are capable of turning a repetitive task into a few lines of code, regardless of how many times you need to repeat that task.

Your challenge today is to create possible destinations for a game, in which the user can choose:

1. Whether you want to go to the Front-End area or go to the Back-End area.

2. If you are in the Front-End area, if you want to learn React or learn Vue. If you are in the Back-End area, you can learn C# or learn Java.

3. Then, regardless of previous choices, the user will be able to choose between continuing to specialize in the chosen area or continuing to develop to become Fullstack. You must display a specific message on the screen for each choice.

4. Finally, ask what technologies the person would like to specialize in or learn about. Here, the person can answer N technologies, one at a time. So, as long as she continues to answer ok to the question: “Is there any other technology you would like to learn?”, continue presenting the Prompt to her, so she can complete the name of the technology in question. And, soon after, present a message commenting something about the inserted language.

The important thing is that the person playing can always choose which decision to make in order to learn and develop in the area of programming.

Furthermore, it is also essential that, at the end of the game, she can include as many technologies as she wants in the learning list.

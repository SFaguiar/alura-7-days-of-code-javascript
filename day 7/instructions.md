This has been quite a week, right?

You've practiced a lot about programming logic with Javascript, but there's still one very important thing missing: organizing your code.

And yes, this is something mandatory to learn as a developer, because at one time or another in your career you will need to maintain your created code, or even fix something in the code that someone else wrote.

Just imagine if this code was all messed up?

A great practice is to always separate each section of your code that will perform a specific function into even smaller blocks of code, which can be reused and called at any other time throughout your program. These are called functions.

For today's exercise: have you ever stopped to think about how a calculator works?

It asks you to enter a number, then you select a type of operation, another number, and it does the calculation itself to show you the result! Incredible, right?

In this last challenge, my proposal to you is: create your own calculator, but with one very important detail: each operation must be a different function in your code.

First, the person must choose an operation option printed by the program on the screen.

Then, she must enter the two values she wants to use, and the program will print the result of the operation in question.

The available options should be: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exit. In the latter case, the program should stop running, showing a "See you next time" message.

# Alura #7DaysOfCode in Programming Logic with Javascript
 A repository where my progress in the #7DaysOfCode "Logic with Javascript" (https://7daysofcode.io/matricula/logica-programacao) challenge is saved. 
## Official description
 During the 7 Days of Logic with Javascript, you will practice with the most used language in the world and learn how to use Javascript to create algorithms and solve everyday problems. Let's see how to use variables, conditionals and loop structures to solve problems that are the foundation that anyone entering the field of programming needs to know. After practicing these concepts for 7 days in a row, you will see that remembering the syntax of the commands and what each one is for will no longer be a difficulty, and you will be able to worry more about how to solve the problems and less about the programming language you are using.
## Day 1 (done in January 9th, 2024)
 On the first day, you will see how what seems like a simple detail can make all the difference in your code and bring the expected and correct result or, depending on how you implement the code, the same command can bring an unexpected result. . On this day, you will learn more about the if statement and Boolean operations within JS.
## Day 2 (done in January 11th, 2024)
 Code lives not only on Boolean conditions and operations, so on the second day of the programming logic challenge you will learn how to work with capturing inputs and how to store this information in variables to use them during the execution of your program.
## Day 3
 On that day, you will bring together everything you saw in the previous days to create a dynamic narrative. And so that this story only ends when the person reading it wants to, you'll need to add loops to do a task over and over again!
## Day 4
 As we are on the topic of games and narratives, how about creating a program to play against the computer? On your fourth day, you will learn how to work with randomness to create a game.
## Day 5
 Lists are everywhere and help us a lot to work with a large volume of information. It is very important that you know how to work with arrays and we have prepared a special day for that!
## Day 6
 After practicing how to insert and manipulate items within a list, you will understand how and when to remove a specific item from the list.
## Day 7
 By now, you will have worked on many different projects practicing various commands and interacting with each other within Javascript. But we still haven't talked about something essential, which is the organization of our code. On the seventh and final day of the challenge, you will develop a larger project, to see how organization or lack thereof can affect your code production and often cause mistakes that you normally wouldn't make.

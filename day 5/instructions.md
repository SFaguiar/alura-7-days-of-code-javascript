You know when you go to the supermarket with a shopping list and end up going back and forth in the same aisles until you complete the list?

You need an apple and go to the fruit area. The next item is a milk and you move on to dairy products. But then you wrote down the pear, and you need to return to the fruit area again.

Once you solve today's challenge, you definitely won't do this again!

Just like our shopping list, it is very common for programs to work with lists of strings, numbers and objects.

Think about every e-commerce catalog you've ever seen, the events list on your Google Calendar, or even in your email inbox. All of these sites use lists to display information in a simple, easy-to-understand way.

Furthermore, you can take advantage of lists to create filters, sorting, and other very useful features.

At this point, you may have already realized that working with these collections is something you will need to master, right?

So today, to make your trip to the supermarket easier, you should create a Javascript program that will ask you if you want to add a food to your shopping list, and you should be able to answer with yes or no.

It will then ask you which food you want to enter, and you will enter its name, such as potatoes.

Afterwards, it should ask which category this food fits into, with some pre-defined options, such as fruits, dairy products, frozen foods, sweets and whatever else you find interesting. This way, you can separate everything into its proper group.

Finally, if you no longer want to add anything to the shopping list and answer no to the first question, it will display a list with all the items grouped together, as follows:

If you add it to your list:
banana, powdered milk, tomato, vegetable milk, gum, teddy bear candy, apple, grapes, avocado and cow's milk

The program should print, for example:

```javascript
Shopping list:
     Fruits: banana, tomato, apple, grape, avocado
     Dairy: plant-based milk, milk, powdered milk
     Frozen:
     Sweets: gum and gummy bear
```

Have you ever tried to guess the number your friend was thinking of? Today you will go back to your childhood and do exactly that. But now, the game will be against the computer itself!

You must create a program that starts with a specific pre-defined value between 0 and 10 for the number you are going to guess (7, for example).

Then, the program will ask you what value you want to guess and, if you get it right, it will congratulate you. If you make a mistake, he will give you 2 more attempts.

In the end, if you don't get it right once, it will print what the initial number was.

Once the program is working, try using a random number instead of a predefined number.

Do you know the little program you created yesterday to create your own shopping list? Today your challenge is to make it even cooler!

You've already seen how to work with arrays in a simple way, adding items to your shopping list.

Another very common operation is removing items from the list and, therefore, it is very important that you know how to do this.

Thinking deeply, there are N ways to delete an item from a list. You can remove the first item, the last item, or any item in the middle of the list. Each of these operations has its own method within the Javascript array documentation. We'll talk more about these methods in the "Tips" section.

You must create the option to remove an item from the list, which will be displayed next to the question “do you want to add a food to the shopping list”?

From there, if the person chooses this option, the program will print the elements present in the current list, and the person must write which one they want to remove.

After that, the program will remove the element from the list and print confirmation that the item is indeed no longer there.

Finally, it will return to the initial cycle of questions.

If, when deleting the item, it is not found in the list, you must display a message notifying you of this.

For example: “The item could not be found in the list!”

Remember that the option to remove an item should only be available when there is at least one item in the shopping list.
